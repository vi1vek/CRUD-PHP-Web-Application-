# CRUD-PHP-Web-Application-
This project aims to develop a simple web-based application using PHP to manage basic user data. The primary focus is to implement core functionalities such as user registration, login, viewing user profiles, and updating user details. The application will utilize a MySQL database to store user information and will focus on fundamental PHP principles for server-side logic.

Features:
User Registration:

Users can sign up by providing basic details like name, email, and password.
The password will be hashed for security purposes before storing it in the database.
User Login:

Registered users can log in by providing their email and password.
Session management will be used to maintain user login status.
Profile Viewing and Updating:

Users can view their profile information after logging in.
Users can update their profile details, including name, email, and password.
Basic Dashboard:

After login, users are redirected to a simple dashboard where they can view their details and access profile settings.
Logout:

Users can securely log out, and their session data will be destroyed.
Technical Stack:
Frontend: Basic HTML/CSS for the user interface.
Backend: PHP for server-side logic.
Database: MySQL to store user data (user ID, name, email, hashed password).
Security: Password hashing using PHP's password_hash() function and session management for user authentication.
Scope and Limitations:
This project is designed as a simple, crude example of PHPâ€™s ability to handle user management.
No advanced features such as email verification, password recovery, or role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented.
Minimal security measures are in place, such as hashing passwords, but no comprehensive security practices like CSRF or SQL injection prevention will be considered in depth.
Potential Future Enhancements:
Email Verification: Add functionality for email verification during user registration.
Password Reset: Implement password recovery through email.
User Role Management: Allow for different types of users (admin, regular user) with role-based permissions.
Improved Security: Add measures like prepared statements for SQL queries, CSRF protection, and XSS mitigation.
This project is ideal for beginners looking to learn basic PHP and MySQL functionality in a real-world context.
